# **Applying Tidy Finance with Python to Vietnam**

A guide to conducting empirical research in finance using Vietnamese market data. [This book](https://mikenguyen13.github.io/tidy_finance_vn/) demonstrates modern data science approaches to financial analysis, portfolio management, and empirical asset pricing using Python with datasets from Vietnamese financial markets.

## Overview

*Applying Tidy Finance with Python to Vietnam* adapts the principles of tidy data and modern statistical computing to the Vietnamese financial context. Rather than being a theoretical finance textbook, this book provides hands-on instruction in accessing, processing, and analyzing real market data from Vietnam's equity markets, enabling readers to conduct research-grade financial analysis.

The book is structured around reproducible workflows that progress from foundational data manipulation techniques to sophisticated econometric methods. Each chapter includes complete code examples and practical applications.

## Key Features

**Vietnamese Market Focus**: All examples use Vietnamese equity market data, making the content immediately applicable to researchers, practitioners, and students interested in emerging market finance.

**Hands-On Data Science**: Learn to work with real market data through reproducible code examples. The book emphasizes tidy data principles and modern computational approaches.

**Publication-Ready Methods**: Chapters cover empirical techniques commonly published in top-tier finance and accounting journals, including factor analysis, portfolio sorts, event studies, and cross-sectional regression methods.

**Practical Tools**: Demonstrates workflows across Python, with emphasis on efficient data management, reproducible research, and best practices in quantitative finance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses Python 3.11+ and requires several scientific and financial computing libraries.

**Package Management**: The project uses `uv` for Python package management, providing fast and reliable dependency resolution.

``` bash
# Install uv (recommended)
# See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/mikenguyen13/tidy_finance_vn.git
    cd tidy_finance_vn
    ```

2.  **Set up the Python environment**:

    ``` bash
    uv sync
    ```

    Or with pip/conda:

    ``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Build the book**:

    ``` bash
    uv run quarto render
    ```

    This generates the HTML book in the `_book/` directory.

### Development Workflow

The project uses Quarto for document rendering. Each chapter is a `.qmd` (Quarto Markdown) file that combines narrative text with executable code.

**Preview chapters while editing**:

``` bash
uv run quarto preview
```

This launches a live preview server with hot-reloading as you modify chapters.
